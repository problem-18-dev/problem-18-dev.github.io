I need to go is out!

Avoid cars, bikers and stay out of the pedestrians' path as you make your way to the urinal.. because you really need to go.

[Play it now on itch.io!](https://problem-18.itch.io/i-need-to-go)

### What's the game?

It's an arcade game based on the [classic Frogger game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger). The player controls a frog which must avoid all kinds of obstacles, jump between them and navigate through moving trees floating on water to get to the other side. What's waiting there? A lilly pad. Five of those, actually. When the player manages to fill all 5 they win and/or proceed to the next level which is slightly more difficult.

"I need to go" is essentially a copy of this in terms of gameplay mechanics. You play as a man who really needs to pee, but the urinals are on the other side. You must jump between cars, eager bikers and last but far from least, pedestrians who are just glued to their phones.

#### Interesting theme you got there!

The theme came naturally. Everyone's been in that rush to find a toilet in emergency situations! The problem however was to bring this idea to life with pixel art and animations. This was my first time diving deep into both, and the result was a bit of a mess. I ended up essentially remaking the game.

Enjoy the game and let me know what you think!
