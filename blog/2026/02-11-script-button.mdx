I discovered a neat little feature in Godot 4.6 (and probably earlier versions). Through a simple toggle, the editor will show a script button next to a scene's title.

Take a look at how to enable it and what it does!

### Functionality

Toggling this feature on displays a script button next to the title of a scene's tab. Pressing this button immediately opens up the script of said scene. This is useful as the project increasingly has more scripts, and more tabs, and more _everything_ open on the screen.

#### Why is that useful?

Well, it's a _personal_ preference.

For me, it's very useful because I tend to get lost between the 2D/Script/Game screens of the Godot Editor, and then also twice as lost if I have a lot of scripts and scenes open.

Now, if I want to open a scene's specific script without looking for it all over the screen, I know exactly where to look. At least if the scene's opened, of course.

### How to enable it

- Go to Editor Settings.
- Proceed to Scene Tabs.
- Toggle the _"Show Script Button"_.

**All done!**

### Conclusion

Now you can quickly open a scene's script without having to look for it all over the screen, especially if you have a lot of scripts and scenes open.

Try it out and let me know what you think!
