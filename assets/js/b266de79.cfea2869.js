A particular issue with the progress not filling or depleting correctly according to its value.\\n\\nYou\'re not alone, let me show you how I fixed it!\\n\\nHead straight to solution? [Feel free!](/progress-texture-bar-issue#solution)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n### Problem\\n\\nWhen I tried using a TextureProgressBar for the first time, I came across a particular issue that had little indication of what was wrong. The visuals did not match the actual values.\\n\\n**I worked with these values:**\\n\\n- Min value: 0.0\\n- Max value: 30.0\\n- Step: 1.0\\n- Rounded: true\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/initial_values.png\'\\n  alt=\'Godot TextureProgressBar properties with values. Min: 0.0, Max: 30.0, Step: 1.0, Rounded: true\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n/>\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n\\n**I used the following sprite (144x24) to use as textures:**\\n\\n![Image of the sprite used for the TextureProgressBar](/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/initial_sprite.png)\\n\\nThis sprite had three layers. Over, Under and Progress, each displaying a different, appropriate texture.\\n\\n##### What\'s happening\\n\\nOkay, let\'s use these textures and make use of our progress bar!\\n\\n1. Set the textures to the progress bar\'s appropriate exposed fields\\n2. Adjust the properties to your liking, I\'ll go with the values mentioned above.\\n3. Set the value to half of your max value.\\n4. See the problem.\\n\\nThe progress is actually less than half of our bar, even though our value is half.\\n\\nSmall demonstration, notice how the progress bar is below half when we\'re at 15.0, and seems empty when we\'re at 4.0, when we\'d expect that to be the case at 0.0 instead.\\n\\n![Animation showing TextureProgressBar bug - bar appears less than half full when value is 15.0 out of 30.0, appears empty when value is 4.0](/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/problem_demonstration.gif)\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nThis is actually caused by the sprites\' size and padding. I learned that Godot requires the textures for \\"Progress\\" and \\"Under\\" to be exactly the amount of pixels of the sprite itself. In contrary, my sprite has some space on the left, which is due to the \\"Over\\" layer.\\n\\n![Progress bar sprite highlighting the padding on the left side that causes the filling issue](/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/progress_texture_with_issue.png)\\n\\nTo solve this, it\'s quite simple. Create separate sprites for each texture layer, ensure there is no padding for the individual textures. Let\'s demonstrate with the Progress texture.\\n\\nLet\'s adjust my sprite as an example.\\n\\n1. Create a new sprite\\n2. Set the dimensions\\n3. Fill up with the texture you want\\n4. Export and use\\n\\n![Step-by-step animation showing how to create a new sprite without padding in Aseprite](/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/solution.gif)\\n\\n**With this exported, we import it into Godot and use it as our progress texture.**\\n\\nImportant: Make sure to adjust the \\"Progress offset\\" property as the progress texture may not align properly otherwise.\\n\\n![Animation showing TextureProgressBar working correctly after removing sprite padding, bar fills appropriately](/img/tutorials/progresstexturebar/solution_demonstration.gif)\\n\\nWith that, the problem is resolved! Lesson for the future when creating a custom progress bar, always make sure there is no padding for the individual textures.\\n\\nThanks for reading! :heart:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I want to read more!\\n\\nIt\'d be my honor.\\n\\n- **[Development of \\"I need to go\\"](i-need-to-go-development)**: The smooth, the tough, and the ugly.\\n- **[About me and Problem 18](about-me-and-problem-18)**: Explanation of me and Problem 18!\\n\\n**Was this helpful?** I\'d appreciate any feedback!

It was a demotivating process that turned out to be very rewarding with patience, sleep and some mercy for myself. In turn, I am now very eager to learn more.\\n\\nI remade \\"I need to go\\" not due to lesser feedback, but due to my own dissatisfaction and gentle need to keep my games up to a certain standard, even if they are just learning experiences.\\n\\nFollow along through my process of realizing this, and further improving the game.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n### Release\\n\\nOriginally releasing the game felt unsatisfying, it felt low in energy, and it felt demotivating. My feelings towards the game weren\'t happy, and I didn\'t feel like I scored yet another win in this challenge of learning game development. Instead I felt like I rushed the project to get it out, due to some invisible time constraints or due to a subconscious need to finish it and move on to learn more and more.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, this lead to me skipping out on details, undervaluing testing, not applying the skills, knowledge and basics I had learned thus far. Even the stuff I was learning on the go wasn\'t utilized to the full potential at that time.\\n\\nSo I decided to take a break from rushing towards the next game. Instead, I told myself to take a break, breathe and let my brain process all that I had learned, and slowly apply it to the game. Fix it, review it, release it again.\\n\\nAll of that to say that I am now happy with where the game is, and I was, and still am genuinely happy to release it, and to know how much I have learned from this more challenging experience.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/i_need_to_go_cover.png\'\\n  alt=\'Cover art for I need to go with pixel art character and game title\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n/>\\n\\n### Art\\n\\nThe art was decent for my first time, yet very lacking. Especially when it came to the color department.\\n\\nI do not mean to bring myself down as it is only normal for my art to be or feel lacking. After all, I am but a beginner whose learning and experience has just begun. Yet when I originally released the game, I felt unsatisfied. Something within me just didn\'t feel good about releasing the game as it was. Not only that, but I received mostly negative feedback due to unresolved or undiscovered bugs, the art being too gray or too similar in color to other sprites.\\n\\nThe game actually didn\'t feel good to play for some, either. The general feeling of friends, family and you - was that it did not feel responsive, and sometimes unfair too.\\n\\n#### Researching color theory\\n\\nDuring my break, I spent more time researching and learning about color theory. I found [this excellent video by YouTuber Watt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hISJ2uflVCg) and he explained so clearly what some of the basic concepts are, and how to apply them to pixel art. A frustrating, yet rewarding process was to finally be able to make my own color palette and **not** be unhappy with it only 5 minutes after trying to use it.\\n\\nI say \\"trying\\" because making a color palette was one thing, but then knowing when, how and where to utilize the colors from this palette was a whole other story. In essence, It took me time to learn the basics, and I remade as good as all the art in the game to be more consistent and easier on the eye.\\n\\n##### Applying color theory\\n\\nMy favorite part so far is knowing how to darken and brighten colors so they better fit together. I used to think that darkening colors is just pushing the hue to a darker tone and that\'s that.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s not! Yet the better way is actual pretty simple. I kept myself to this rule:\\n\\"Brighten colors by shifting the hue toward yellow, darken colors by shifting the hue toward blue. Adjust saturation and value accordingly.\\"\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/general/darkening_color.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Animation showing how to darken colors by shifting hue toward blue, adjusting saturation and value\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n/>\\n\\n#### Level design\\n\\nI began with recreating tile map for the level. Not necessarily in quality of details, but in colors. Throughout my research, I learned about complementary and analogous colors, as well as HSV (Hue, Saturation, Vibrance). With the basics of that in my head, I began to see how to use them a bit more, and tried my best on the new tile map. The level is now an actual background, as is expected from this game. The colors pop, they portray what they need to, without striking you or taking attention away from the obstacles.\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', gap: \'4px\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/old_level_design.png\'\\n    alt=\'Original level design with clashing colors\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/new_level_design.png\'\\n    alt=\'Improved level design with new color palette and better color work\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Obstacles\\n\\nThe obstacles have all received either a complete recreation, or some updates to better reflect what they are supposed to be. This can either be in coloring, minor details, or even size!\\n\\n**Here\'s the cars getting a complete recreation:**\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', gap: \'4px\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/car_old.png\'\\n    alt=\'Old car sprite - blocky pixel art with gray colors and lesser details\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/car_new.png\'\\n    alt=\'New car sprite - reworked design with preferable proportions and color work\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\n**The biker is now a responsible biker:**\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', gap: \'4px\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/biker_old.png\'\\n    alt=\'Old biker sprite with gray colors and without helmet\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/biker_new.png\'\\n    alt=\'New biker sprite with better colors and helmet\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\n**The pedestrian received a color change:**\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', gap: \'4px\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/pedestrian_old.png\'\\n    alt=\'Old pedestrian sprite with gray colors and without details\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n  <img\\n    src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/pedestrian_new.png\'\\n    alt=\'New pedestrian sprite with better colors that blend better with level design\'\\n    width=\'50%\'\\n  />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\nAs you can hopefully see, the art is much more detailed. This improvement is the effect of letting my brain process what I had learned, and the practice I had put into it before that. Instead, I rushed through everything.\\n\\n### Gameplay\\n\\nThe gameplay has more or less stayed the same. Biggest change from the original version was that I made the level more consistent.\\n\\n#### Unfair level design\\n\\nI didn\'t know how to make it work at first, and instead of being patient and letting some critical thinking happen through sleep or processing, I rushed. This caused the following issue:\\nSome lanes stretched more than how much distance per move the player made, causing them to have to move twice to get out of a lane.\\n\\nThis was very confusing to most players, and felt quite unfair too. The fix was to make the width of the lanes equal to the distance per move the player made.\\n\\n#### Let\'s compare!\\n\\n**Original:** notice how you need to make _more than two_ moves to get through two lanes.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/gameplay_old.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Original gameplay showing unfair lane sizing, player needs multiple moves to cross single lane\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n/>\\n\\n**Improved:** notice how you need to make _only_ two moves to get through two lanes.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/gameplay_new.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Improved gameplay with fair lane sizing, one move crosses one lane exactly\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n/>\\n\\n#### Obstacle spawning\\n\\nA smaller yet crucial issue, I completely overestimated the average player\'s ability to understand how to play, and how unfair it is of me to make a level so or so difficult. A level that felt very easy to me, was a serious challenge for someone else.\\n\\n- Too quick spawning of obstacles\\n- Not enough space between obstacles\\n\\nOn the other hand, more experienced players figured out the levels instantly and rushed through them. This was because **the obstacles were spawning at the same frequency, in the same location**. Quickly a pattern was to be found and so the level solved quickly.\\n\\nI solved this by simplifying the spawning logic, and simply adjusting the speed of the obstacles, and their spawn position set off from different points of the x-axis.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWithout a doubt, getting the hang of the very basics of color theory and applying it was the most difficult task for me to tackle in this challenge so far. Gameplay balancing is tricky too, and definitely something to keep in mind for the next game.\\n\\nAll this to say that I actually learned so much in hindsight, and this motivates me a lot to keep pushing through the difficulty, to not let frustration allow me to rush or give up. The aftermath is always full of progress.\\n\\nIf you have any feedback or stories of your own to share, feel free to reach out on social media!\\n\\nThanks for reading! :heart:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I want to read more!\\n\\nIt\'d be my honor.\\n\\n- **[I need to go released!](i-need-to-go-release)**: Play the game yourself!\\n- **[Development of \\"I need to go\\"](i-need-to-go-development)**: The smooth, the tough, and the ugly.\\n- **[About me and Problem 18](about-me-and-problem-18)**: Explanation of me and Problem 18!"},{"id":"i-need-to-go-development","metadata":{"permalink":"/i-need-to-go-development","source":"@site/blog/2026/02-04-i-need-to-go-development.mdx","title":"Development of \\"I need to go\\"","description":"Learn how I built a Frogger clone in Godot with grid-based movement, RayCast2D collision detection, and pixel art animation.

Not only on a technical level, but an artistic one too. Here\'s how I dealt with it, and how the game came to be.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n### About the game\\n\\nThe game is a Frogger clone, but with a twist. You play as a man who really needs to pee, but the urinals are on the other side. You must jump between cars, eager bikers and last but far from least, pedestrians who are just glued to their phones.\\n\\nYou can read more about that in the game\'s announcement post: [I need to go is out!](i-need-to-go-release)\\n\\nWith that said, let\'s take a look at the development of the game, starting off with the smooth parts of it. :blush:\\n\\n### The smooth\\n\\nAs time moves on, I\'m getting better and better at using Godot and its features. I noticed that getting started with creating scenes, managing them, and keeping them scalable comes to me quicker. OOP (Object-oriented programming) is nothing new to me, and with that, creating inheritable scenes didn\'t prove to be the most difficult thing.\\n\\nI used it to create a base scene for all the obstacles the player can come against, and gave it an empty [AnimatedSprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite2d.html) and [CollisionShape2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2d.html). Inheriting this scene then allowed for quicker iteration to create the different obstacles like the biker, the car, ...\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/obstacle_scene.png\'\\n  alt=\'Screenshot of Godot editor showing base obstacle scene with AnimatedSprite2D and CollisionShape2D nodes\'\\n/>\\n\\n#### Scripting\\n\\n##### Obstacles\\n\\nI wrote scripts with the future in mind, particularly inheritance and scalability. The base scene contained a script that I knew every obstacle would have to use, for example movement, flipping itself (i.e. when it has to go to the right), destroying itself when out of bounds, etc.\\n\\n[You can view all the code on my Github](https://github.com/problem-18-dev/I-need-to-go), but essentially all obstacles need to move at a certain speed, in the left/right direction, and depending on that direction all properties must be flipped like the CollisionShape2D, the AnimatedSprite2D, etc.\\n\\n```gdscript\\n@export_category(\\"Entity\\")\\n@export var speed: float\\n\\nvar _can_die := false\\nvar _direction := Vector2.LEFT\\n\\nfunc _process(delta: float) -> void:\\n  position += _direction * speed * delta\\n\\n\\nfunc flip() -> void:\\n  _direction = Vector2.RIGHT\\n  $AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = true\\n  $VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D.position.x *= -1\\n```\\n\\n##### Player\\n\\nWriting the main character proved to be a little difficult, particularly with movement, since the point was to keep the player moving in specific distances every time. All this to say that all in all, while initially quite tricky, the ideas I had for how the movement should technically work were not far from what the script looks like at the end of it.\\n\\n**Here\'s a snippet with an explanation:**\\n\\n```gdscript\\nfunc _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:\\n  # If we\'re already at the target position, return\\n  if next_position.is_equal_approx(position):\\n    return\\n\\n  # If we\'re very close to the target position, snap to it.\\n  # This was to prevent a bug where the character would keep moving\\n  # slightly past the target position and entering and endless loop.\\n  var distance_to_target := position.distance_to(next_position)\\n  if distance_to_target <= move_speed * delta:\\n      position = next_position\\n      _can_move = true\\n      # Emit signal to indicate that the player has moved, used for points\\n      moved.emit()\\n      return\\n\\n  # Set can_move to false and calculate the direction to the next position\\n  _can_move = false\\n  var direction := position.direction_to(next_position)\\n\\n  # Move\\n  velocity = direction * move_speed\\n  move_and_slide()\\n```\\n\\n#### Raycasts\\n\\nAside from this, the biggest lesson learned was how to use [RayCast2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_raycast2d.html). I used them for two important things:\\n\\n1. Checking whether the player can move in a certain direction. (I.e. block movement if raycast collides with a wall).\\n2. Checking if the player is in front of the pedestrian, in which case the pedestrian will push the player back.\\n\\nThe most interesting part, and one that took most time to figure out, was the [force_update_transform](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem.html#class-canvasitem-method-force-update-transform) function call. It was necessary to call this as we\'re checking the raycast\'s collision outside of the physics process, and because of that I needed to manually update its transform.\\n\\n**Here\'s the player\'s script that uses raycasts to detect if there\'s a wall in the next move:**\\n\\n```gdscript\\n# Assign raycasts to a dictionary with the direction as the key\\n@onready var raycasts := {\\n  Vector2.RIGHT: $RightRayCast2D,\\n  Vector2.LEFT: $LeftRayCast2D,\\n  Vector2.UP: $TopRayCast2D,\\n  Vector2.DOWN: $BottomRayCast2D\\n}\\n\\nfunc _unhandled_key_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:\\n  if not _can_move:\\n    return\\n\\n  if event.is_action_pressed(\\"move_right\\"):\\n    _try_move(Vector2.RIGHT, \\"walk_side\\")\\n  elif event.is_action_pressed(\\"move_left\\"):\\n    _try_move(Vector2.LEFT, \\"walk_side\\", true)\\n  elif event.is_action_pressed(\\"move_up\\"):\\n    _try_move(Vector2.UP, \\"walk_vertical\\")\\n  elif event.is_action_pressed(\\"move_down\\"):\\n    _try_move(Vector2.DOWN, \\"walk_vertical\\", true)\\n\\nfunc _try_move(direction: Vector2, animation: String, flip_h: bool = false) -> void:\\n  # Get the raycast for the direction\\n  var raycast: RayCast2D = raycasts.get(direction)\\n  assert(raycast, \\"Invalid direction, raycast doesn\'t exist\\")\\n\\n  # Force update the raycast.\\n  # This was something I learned on a whim from Godot\'s documentation,\\n  # and some friendly people on Reddit!\\n  raycast.force_update_transform()\\n\\n  # If raycast doesn\'t collide with any wall, allow movement\\n  if not raycast.is_colliding():\\n    next_position += direction * move_distance\\n    animated_sprite.play(animation)\\n    animated_sprite.flip_h = flip_h\\n```\\n\\n#### HUD\\n\\nThe HUD itself was a piece of cake, actually. The only struggle I had was with the TextureProgressBar, and I had an annoying issue that I couldn\'t find much about. I fixed it, you can read about that in a separate post if you wish!\\n\\nRead it here: [TextureProgressBar issue in Godot](progress-texture-bar-issue)\\n\\n![Game HUD showing lives counter, score, and TextureProgressBar timer in pixel art style](/img/games/i-need-to-go/hud.png)\\n\\n#### Initial art\\n\\nI say initial because I want to strictly talk about the sprites and their **first** frame. My art took some time to work decently, I watched plenty of videos on the basics of 2D art, ranging from how to draw characters, to what shading is.\\n\\nAll in all, I expect anyone to say that my art is beginner\'s art and I want that too. For one, because it\'d feel weird not to have to improve, and because I want there to be a LOT of space for improvement for future comparisons, oh and because I suck at art. Nevertheless, beginner\'s work or not, my sprites resembled what I wanted them to resemble and that was plenty enough for me.\\n\\n> I suck at art, and I\'m proud of that.\\n>\\n> Let me cope.\\n>\\n> \u2014 Me\\n\\n### The tough\\n\\nAfter the initial sprites came the mission to animate them. This felt and sounded quite daunting to me as I\'ve never even dipped a single finger in the world of animation. It\'s just never been a thing I had done before.\\n\\n#### Thank you, YouTube creators!\\n\\nThrough various tutorials on YouTube regarding 2D art, animation, and color theory, the challenge became much less scary with each frame I drew. In the beginning it took me literal hours just to get the most basic walking animation and consider it okay. I don\'t know if perfectionism took over or not, but the most basic of movement you can think of, and I want you to think of two frames or so, would just not work for me.\\n\\nWith practice, it became slightly easier and what you now see in the game is what I ended up with. I frequently took inspiration from photos online by literally searching what I was trying to draw but add \\"from the side\\" and that gave me decent models to work off of.\\n\\n**Here\'s my attempt at drawing a truck, which was later replaced with a prettier car:**\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/car_old.png\'\\n  alt=\'Original pixel art sprite of a truck from early development of I need to go, gray and blocky design\'\\n  width=\'70%\'\\n/>\\n\\nYou can see the final car in the game in a separate post I made about the improvements: [Improving \\"I need to go\\"](i-need-to-go-improvements)\\n\\n#### I never thought colors could be this difficult\\n\\nLet me tell you, drawing these sprites and making them move was one problem. Having them colored properly, consistently and in a way that doesn\'t **literally** hurt the eye, was a pain in the ass. I had watched so many videos on color theory, on how to create a color palette of my own, how to pick appropriate ones from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/), and how to apply them in my art. What a difficult skill this is to learn, let alone to master (oh, god)! I would have never expected this to be the biggest challenge to have during the creation of this game.\\n\\nInitially, I was genuinely getting frustrated. Any color palette I chose, or made myself, I discarded 5 minutes later. I just couldn\'t get it to work, I couldn\'t get it to match the vision I had for this art, for this game. I kept trying for days, my whole weekend went on that. To be clear, I do not regret it and I want to learn more, and improve a lot as I go. I want to state that I genuinely have so much more respect for even the worst reviewed games, art, movies, .. Now that I have had a small taste of how difficult and time-stealing this is.\\n\\nLuckily, just a mere night of good sleep resulted in me feeling more decisive and confident with my choices, and perhaps more patient with how art comes together when the colors are used all over the place instead of on just one sprite of many.\\n\\n**Here\'s the original level design, the colors are very striking and don\'t work well together:**\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'/img/games/i-need-to-go/old_level_design.png\'\\n  alt=\'Original level design with clashing colors and poor color work\'\\n  width=\'70%\'\\n/>\\n\\n### The ugly\\n\\nI rushed the development during the last days and forcibly worked on it to get it out to the public. That\'s it. That\'s the biggest and ugliest mistake I made so far in the game development journey.\\n\\nThe mixture of learning how to create art, realizing how difficult it is, combined with some code being tricky (remember the initial movement trickiness of the player), subconsciously made me rush the game to be done with it.\\n\\n#### This game didn\'t feel good to develop\\n\\nAt this point, I cannot tell you yet why exactly as I am still discovering that myself, but **something about this game just didn\'t really motivate me**. Maybe it\'s the genre of the game, or its mechanics but nothing about it really excited me.\\n\\nOf course, the obvious answer may be what I mentioned above regarding learning art.\\n\\n#### The general feedback\\n\\nThe level design, game\'s difficulty, and art didn\'t receive good feedback from friends, family and the lovely people out there who gave the game a shot. Too gray, too bland, not clear enough, too slow, too fast, .. List goes on.\\n\\nThis, alongside my own dissatisfaction from how I rushed the process and forgot that everything I am doing is to have fun and learn, motivated me to remake all the art, review all of the scripts I had written, test more extensively to catch bugs, etc.\\n\\n#### Original announcement\\n\\nAfter I originally announced the game, it didn\'t feel good. I did not feel like I just achieved something, I did not feel like I felt with the first two games, Tricat and Keybricks. Something was missing. I felt a strong sense of de-motivation. I think the little voice inside me was shouting that I didn\'t put the effort into the game. That with a few tweaks and, most importantly, patience, it can be a much better working & looking game.\\n\\nSo I told myself and everyone else that instead of diving into the next game (Asteroids, by the way), I should take at least a week to process everything I had learned so far, and in the meantime also apply all of it into the game.\\n\\n#### Re-ignition\\n\\nAt the end of it all, this made me very passionate. As soon as I began working on the game with the goal to improve it, I noticed in many ways that I have improved in my art, albeit so slightly. I was faster at drawing, making decisions, and spent way less hours drawing again and again. The code that felt flaky, I saw much better and found many ways to improve it. This lead me to learning with pleasure again, and coming to today.\\n\\nA day when I release the game and am actually happy about it, I spent a lot more effort and time into the promotion of it. Creating a more proper cover art for itch.io, created a better logo. I\'m proud of my work!\\n\\nI explore this process a lot more in a separate post: [Improving \\"I need to go\\"](i-need-to-go-improvements)\\n\\n### Lessons learned\\n\\nMany of them, and on many levels.\\n\\nTechnically, I understand more about Godot and game programming patterns.\\n\\nArtistically, my basics in 2D art and animation have definitely seen improvement, and I cannot wait to improve much more.\\n\\nMentally, I am still figuring out what makes me tick, and in what way. One thing is clear though, I really enjoy making games so far, even if some parts of it feel tedious, outright frustrating, or even demotivating.\\n\\nTo sum up the technical stuff:\\n\\n- Raycasts are very cool, not sure about optimal use cases though.\\n- TextureProgressBar is quirky but awesome otherwise!\\n- Grid/distance/step-based movement\\n\\n[Let me know what you think of the game, try it out on itch.io!](https://problem-18.itch.io/i-need-to-go)\\n\\nHopefully my games, and with them, my learnings can bring some value to you on your own journey!\\n\\nThanks for reading! :heart:\\n\\n![Cover art for I need to go with pixel art character and game title](/img/games/i-need-to-go/i_need_to_go_cover.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I want to read more!\\n\\nIt\'d be my honor.\\n\\n- **[I need to go released!](i-need-to-go-release)**: Play the game yourself!\\n- **[Improving \\"I need to go\\"](i-need-to-go-improvements)**: Learning about color theory and comparing!\\n- **[TextureProgressBar issue in Godot](progress-texture-bar-issue)**: A tutorial on fixing a UI issue."},{"id":"i-need-to-go-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/i-need-to-go-release","source":"@site/blog/2026/02-04-i-need-to-go.mdx","title":"I need to go released!","description":"Play I need to go for free on itch.io, a Frogger-clone game where you dodge cars, bikers, and pedestrians to reach the urinal.

It required for me to think of what I actually want this game to be, what my own twist on it would be, and most importantly, how do I even create it?\\n\\nHow did I get to the theme of the bricks being key caps, the paddle a space bar?\\n\\nWhat makes it different from the original Breakout game?\\n\\nWith Godot\'s documentation on my second screen, I went to work by first thinking of the answer to these questions. Quite quickly I found myself thinking of keyboards. Their key caps, to be specific. I mean, they **are** bricks in essence, so why not have them as such in the game? Surround the level in some walls, let the ball hit some key caps.\\n\\n#### It can be even better!\\n\\nWith the idea, came other ideas. What if the paddle is a space bar? What if the key caps actually have letters on them? What if hitting a key cap means actually typing something?\\n\\nWith all these questions in mind, I had enough of a vision on this to start working, and off I went. Only to quickly stumble into a problem.\\n\\n### Key caps and scope\\n\\nWith all these ideas, came decisions. These decisions were made without thinking of the system behind it which quickly caused me to get stuck. I wanted the key caps to actually type something when they\'re hit, so I came up with this idea that a specific word could be spelled per level, if the correct key cap is hit and destroyed. Initially, this was supposed to be a sub-goal to pass the level. Spell the word out within the timer, or the level is lost.\\n\\nThis added a lot more scope than I wanted it to. I would\'ve had to keep a time in mind, make sure the key caps spawn and randomize fairly, and balance the game with the ball\'s and paddle\'s speeds to do that as well.\\n\\nThe scope increased from \\"keep the ball in play, destroy all the bricks\\" to \\"keep the ball in play, destroy all the bricks, spell out the word, do that within time\\". That is a lot of extra scope for something that wasn\'t necessary, yet at the time I felt otherwise and kept working with that idea in mind.\\n\\nAnd so, my first time of experiencing scope creep occurred. A lesson was learned here!\\n\\n#### Prototype before committing.\\n\\nIf you want to see it listed:\\n\\n- Randomize the key caps\\n- Give the key caps an appropriate spawn position\\n- Spawn enough of said key caps to make the spelling possible\\n- Keep tabs on the timer\\n\\n#### At the time, this seemed to be a simple addition. It wasn\'t.\\n\\nSo off I go, working on the game, trying to put these systems together. Let\'s review them one by one.\\n\\n### The key cap\\n\\nCreating the key cap scene itself was simple, I drew a **very** basic key cap-ish shape in Aseprite, put that in a [Sprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d.html), set a character inside the sprite, added a collision shape and considered it done.\\n\\nLater on I did add various \\"difficulties\\" to the key caps, green being easy, orange being medium, and red being hard. Each representing how many times the key cap would have to be hit, to be considered destroyed and thus taken away from the level. However, there\'s not much need in going in depth about that for now.\\n\\n![Pixel art key cap in green color](/img/games/keybricks/keycap.png)\\n\\n### Randomize the key caps\\n\\nI put a few key caps onto the main scene and wanted to create an algorithm to assign a random letter to each key cap. I used unicode to pick a random character between A and Z. Assigned the character to the key cap that was being spawned and that actually worked better than I expected.\\n\\nHere\'s most of the code to get that going:\\n\\n```gdscript\\n@export var rows := 1\\n@export var columns := 1\\n\\nfor x in columns:\\n  for y in rows:\\n    var brick: Brick = _brick_scene.instantiate()\\n    var size := brick.get_size()\\n    var position_offset := size / 2.0\\n    var x_position := float((position.x + position_offset.x) + size.x * (x - 1))\\n    var y_position := float((position.y + position_offset.y) + size.y * (y - 1))\\n    brick.difficulty = difficulty\\n    add_child(brick)\\n    brick.global_position = Vector2(x_position, y_position)\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s actually quite simple, we get the brick\'s size, we offset it\'s position by said size, and then for each column and row we spawn a brick. This was used in a scene called [`brick_set`](https://github.com/problem-18-dev/KeyBricks/blob/main/scenes/brick_set/brick_set.gd), and it\'s sole responsibility was to take care of the spawning.\\n\\nThe parent node took care of assigning the letter, as it was easier to keep the word to spell out in mind.\\n\\n```gdscript\\nvar bricks := get_tree().get_nodes_in_group(\\"bricks\\")\\nvar letter_attempts := 0\\nfor i in bricks.size():\\n    var letter := String.chr(randi_range(A, Z))\\n    letter_attempts = 0 if available_letters.has(letter) else letter_attempts + 1\\n\\n    if available_letters.size() > 0:\\n        if available_letters.has(letter):\\n            var letter_index := available_letters.find(letter)\\n            available_letters.remove_at(letter_index)\\n            letter_attempts = 0\\n        elif letter_attempts >= max_letter_attempts:\\n            var letter_index := randi_range(0, available_letters.size() - 1)\\n            letter = available_letters[letter_index]\\n            available_letters.remove_at(letter_index)\\n            letter_attempts = 0\\n\\n    var brick: Brick = bricks[i]\\n    brick.brick_destroyed.connect(_on_brick_destroyed)\\n    brick.change_letter(letter)\\n```\\n\\nFor every brick, we get a random letter, we keep count of how many attempts were made to assign a letter from the assigned word to the brick. I did this to make sure that the word is actually spellable every time, and not just rely on hopeful random generation.\\n\\n### The unnecessary scope\\n\\nNow the word to spell out came into play, and this was actually not too bad. It was a simple matter of using _signals_ to let the level scene know every time a brick was destroyed, the level would then compare and fill in the necessary letters in the word.\\n\\n#### Signals?\\n\\n[Signals are awesome](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_signal.html). Using them allowed me to connect events happening in child nodes, to trigger events to happen in the parent node, and as a nice side-effect trigger all kinds of events in other child nodes.\\n\\nA brick gets destroyed, emits a signal to let the level scene know which letter it had, the level would evaluate whether this letter is useful for the word, and adjust the HUD.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the timer having to be a deciding factor in the player winning or losing felt more and more out of pocket. I realized that such a timer should not be punishing, and only adding to the game\'s fun, instead of taking away from it. Only then to simply drop the timer as it did not feel fun during testing.\\n\\n### The bounce of the ball\\n\\nMy first implementation of the ball was to use [Godot\'s built-in bounce function](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-bounce) on every surface, and I thought that that would be it.\\n\\n> It bounces, yay!\\n>\\n> \u2014 Me\\n\\nRelying on Godot\'s built-in functionality and physics was absolutely the way to go, however it wasn\'t a solution for every situation. The ball\'s movement was too random and left the player only an illusion of control. I realized the paddle should reverse the ball\'s direction and not just be another wall to bounce on.\\n\\nSo I stood up, imagined myself being the paddle and the ball approaching me. The ball arrives at my left shoulder, bounces off and flies to my right. Okay, so the solution is to revert that. Why not just take the direction I am looking at when the ball bounces off of me, and change the ball\'s course into that direction.\\n\\nAnd that\'s how I solved it when I found [`direction_to()` in Godot\'s documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-direction-to).\\n\\n```gdscript\\n_direction = _direction.bounce(collision.get_normal())\\nif collider is Paddle:\\n    _direction = collider.position.direction_to(position)\\n```\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'img/games/keybricks/paddle_bounce.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Ball bounces off the paddle in opposite direction\'\\n  width=\'60%\'\\n/>\\n\\n### Last but not least\\n\\nAfter working out the key caps and their randomization, the ball\'s bounce, and giving the player control in return, I finally was able to refine other stuff of the game.\\n\\nI reworked the sprites for the walls, the key caps and the space bar. Did my best to give them some kind of shading or depth, but it\'s up to you whether I actually succeeded. :smile:\\n\\nI learned to create a [`Main` scene](https://github.com/problem-18-dev/KeyBricks/blob/main/main.gd) to better manage level transitions, and keep data & state even as levels change. I learned how to make a simple AudioManager by following [an excellent tutorial from KidsCanCode](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/audio/index.html).\\n\\nI put a little bit more effort into the sound effects by capturing my own keyboard, and me knocking on the wall. You can probably guess which sound went towards with part of the game.\\n\\n### Lessons learned\\n\\nThis game is easily my best one so far. Of course, there isn\'t much to choose from but I am very proud of it. I think I managed to make a satisfying and responsive game, courtesy of my keyboard\'s sounds! A lot of new knowledge was gained through the development of this game, and it only made me more excited to share, improve and keep it up for the next game!\\n\\nSome of the lessons I brought along with me:\\n\\n- The difference between [move_and_slide()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d-method-move-and-slide) and [move_and_collide()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_physicsbody2d.html#class-physicsbody2d-method-move-and-collide).\\n- Basics of the AnimationPlayer to create some floating keybricks for the main menu and end screen.\\n- Better scene management (Main scene).\\n- That even a simple idea extra on top of the original idea, can lengthen development by double, if not more.\\n- Next time, I should prototype before sticking to an idea until it\'s late.\\n\\nTry Keybricks on itch.io and let me know what you think, was I right to say it\'s a responsive and satisfying game? I\'ll see you in the next post.

A Flappy Bird clone, with a small twist on the theme. In this case it being a black cat that has to avoid brooms with a purple and starry background representing the night. The player has to jump using their mouse button or space to keep the the cat afloat and avoiding the brooms.\\n\\n### How I started\\n\\nI started off by going through [the engine\'s documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html) first. Getting to know what design principles, key concepts and interfaces are in store for me.\\n\\nAfter the introduction, I followed the excellently written tutorial on how to create [your first 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html). This involved using pre-made assets, writing code, and research the workflow of scenes and nodes. A smooth experience that allowed me to easily step into the world of Godot, at least regarding 2D.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'img/godot/2d_demo.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Godot 2D demo game showing player dodging enemies and collecting coins\'\\n/>\\n\\n### Tricat\\n\\nFirst mistake: Sitting down, saying \\"Time to work on the first game!\\", and realizing that I actually had no idea **what** I want to make. I mean sure, it\'s a flappy bird clone.. but what? Well, luckily someone gave me a suggestion!\\n\\nThe game\'s theme was inspired by a cat belonging to someone very close to me, this poor cat only has three legs (but zooms around like a demon regardless).\\n\\nThe same person actually hinted me towards the direction of what the game\'s theme should be. \\"A black cat being hunted by a witch on a broom at night\\".\\n\\n#### Sounds cool but..\\n\\nWhat immediately stuck is that imagining, and talking about a game idea is easy. However, then it clicks that every single movement, every single sound and gameplay mechanic is something that has to be created from scratch, every time.\\nQuite daunting but I did **not** let that overwhelm me.\\n\\nI opened up Notion, created some pages where I basically copy/pasted the requirements set in the [20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/), and so I could easily have a checklist of what is to be done. This allowed development to be much less overwhelming, and having the game done in small, incremental steps allowed me to quickly get started, and finished too.\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'img/games/tricat/tricat_notion.png\'\\n  alt=\\"Tricat\'s to-do list with checkboxes for each task\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### What about the actual creation?\\n\\nThe art was done using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) which I had purchased quite some time ago and never really used. It was overwhelming at first but [this excellent tutorial by YouTuber Saultoons](https://youtu.be/tFsETEP01k8?si=jYvA6PJDsh0FvZxm) explained Aseprite to me enough to get started.\\n\\nSound effects were a totally new area for me. I installed [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and just recorded some random noises using my own mouth. It was silly, it was funny, and damn, it was an adventure! I must say, Audacity is so simple to use, it\'s so cool that it\'s free.\\n\\nIn the end, all it took was making some random noises, who knew!\\n\\n### Biggest hurdles\\n\\n#### Collisions and types\\n\\nLots of time went into figuring out and puzzling. Should the little cat be a [RigidBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody2d.html) (let physics do the work)? Perhaps a [CharacterBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html) (handle control and movement myself through scripting)? After all, it is our character, and it is a character we want to control. Turns out that CharacterBody2D was the right call for me.\\n\\nSame thing for the brooms, after hours of tinkering and _more_ puzzling, I settled on Area2D\'s that just move to the left.\\n\\n> Oh my god, why are they not colliding?!\\n>\\n> \u2014 Me\\n\\nIt took tinkering and time for me to understand how bodies and areas work between each other, whether it\'s okay and efficient to have an Area2D move to the left while a body comes into it\'s [CollisionShape2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2d.html). I quickly found out that this worked just fine, actually.\\n\\n#### Spawning of brooms\\n\\nAnother big one was the spawning of the brooms with a random position on the y-axis. We want to spawn them in a certain distance from each other, while also randomizing keeping the height of the gap at different spots. Otherwise, the game would be very simple and just spawn the exact same brooms, with the exact same distance and position every time.\\n\\nSo I created a new scene that contains two brooms, I set up a script that would put a distance between them. In a parent node, another script determined the height of this new scene, and that way it did exactly what was necessary.\\n\\nOh, and the spawning was determined by a [Path2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_path2d.html) and just choosing a random location.\\n\\nHere\'s a snippet of some of the code used.\\n\\n```gdscript\\n# Put distance between the two brooms\\n$UpperBroom.position.y -= distance\\n$LowerBroom.position.y += distance\\n\\n# Spawn set of brooms at random location of Path2D\\nvar obstacle_set := obstacle_scene.instantiate()\\nvar spawn_location = $ObstaclePath/ObstacleSpawnLocation\\nspawn_location.progress_ratio = randf()\\nobstacle_set.position = spawn_location.position\\nadd_child(obstacle_set)\\n```\\n\\n### What I learned\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the game wasn\'t the most difficult to create. Due to my experience and knowledge of coding, I was able to get a quick prototype going and it rolled off the hill easily after that.\\n\\nI was very excited to have had finished, as I heard more than enough that actually finishing a game is the hardest part of game development. While the game perhaps is small, it was still a big achievement for me personally.\\n\\nFor the next game, Keybricks, I brought along the following lessons:\\n\\n- Godot\'s documentation is absolutely golden, and I will keep using it first.\\n- Have a concrete idea of the game\'s theme before you actually start working.\\n- GDScript, Aseprite & Audacity basics.\\n- How collisions between areas and bodies work.\\n\\nThat\'s all! :heart:\\n\\n[Try Tricat and let me know what you think!](https://problem-18.itch.io/tricat)\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'img/games/tricat/gameplay_demo.gif\'\\n  alt=\'Gameplay demonstration of Tricat showing black cat jumping between brooms in starry night background\'\\n  width=\'75%\'\\n/>\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I want to read more!\\n\\nIt\'d be my honor!\\n\\n- **[Keybricks released!](keybricks-release)**: My second game about hitting key caps!\\n- **[About me and Problem 18](about-me-and-problem-18)**: Explanation of me and Problem 18!"},{"id":"about-me-and-problem-18","metadata":{"permalink":"/about-me-and-problem-18","source":"@site/blog/2026/01-02-about-me-and-problem-18.mdx","title":"About me and Problem 18!","description":"Follow my public journey learning game development with the 20 games challenge.

Despite multiple very small attempts, I\'ve never really put much effort into it. Problem 18 is my public journey to finally turn this interest into a skill, one game and 18 days at a time.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n### Who am I?\\n\\nTo start off, here\'s a quick gist about me:\\n\\n- I\'m 26 years old. (This is easy to know by looking at what year we\'re in!)\\n- I\'m Belgian.\\n- I work as a software engineer by day.\\n- I have essentially no game development experience aside from **very** basic tutorials over years.\\n\\n### What is Problem 18?\\n\\nProblem 18 is my idea to publicize my journey to learn game development and to transform it into a strong hobby, with the intent to later move on and make a game of my own.\\n\\nWith my knowledge and experience in coding, starting off with simple games was definitely the right first step. I took a few looks through Reddit and other social medias to find out that the [20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/ \'Link to the 20 games challenge website\') is a popular way of getting started with game development for people who already have got the learning of programming out of the way.\\n\\nSo I told myself that if I want to finally make games instead of dreaming about it, this challenge is one hell of a way to start doing so.\\n\\n#### Why do it publicly?\\n\\nBecause I know myself, and I realize that I quickly feel lonely during exploration of new hobbies, skills and interests.\\n\\nAdditionally, I would like to earn my place and belong in the game development community, and by keeping my games, my learnings and mistakes honest in public, I hope to do just that.\\n\\nI even created a whole brand design, including this header. :smile:\\n\\n![Problem 18 brand banner showing logo and tagline - Learning game development 18 days at a time](/img/brand/problem18-banner.jpg)\\n\\n### Why \\"18\\"?\\n\\nTo keep myself to some discipline, as well as to keep the show going consistently, I decided that creating a game (and following the challenge) every 18 days would be a reasonable task. The number 18 was chosen for no particular reason other than my guess for how long on average every game would take, especially considering that I\'m starting from zero.\\n\\nI am aware that as I move up, the difficulty and scope of each game increases and we\'ll step beyond those 18 days sooner or later. Not to mention that I am learning many aspects on the go, and aim to have at the very least basic knowledge and skills in all of them by the time the challenge is done.\\n\\nI\'ve definitely got my work cut out for me, but I am not scared of it. In fact, I am so excited to be learning all these new skills, to get my creation out there, even if it\'s just to a few people.\\n\\n### Games\\n\\nThe games you can expect will be clones of cult classic games, starting from Flappy Bird, ending with Minecraft. On each game, I plan to add a small twist of my own. Whether that\'s the theme, some new mechanic or mood. Every game is taken from the 20 games challenge.\\n\\nThe plan as of today, followed by planned release date:\\n\\n- [Flappy Bird](https://problem-18.itch.io/tricat) (January 18, 2026)\\n- [Breakout](https://problem-18.itch.io/keybricks) (February 5, 2026)\\n- [Frogger](https://problem-18.itch.io/i-need-to-go) (February 23, 2026)\\n- Asteroids (March 13, 2026)\\n- Pac-man (March 31, 2026)\\n- Super Mario Bros (April 18, 2026)\\n- Worms (May 6, 2026)\\n- Crash Bandicoot (May 24, 2026)\\n- Doom (June 11, 2026)\\n- Minecraft (June 30, 2026)\\n\\nSo yeah, lots of work ahead of me. However, as of the day I\'m writing this, I am semi-finished with Frogger and it\'s basically a month before the deadline. The game I\'m most proud of right now is [Keybricks](https://problem-18.itch.io/keybricks).\\n\\n<img\\n  src=\'img/games/keybricks/keybricks_logo.png\'\\n  width=\'50%\'\\n  alt=\'Keybricks game logo with key caps pixel art\'\\n/>\\n\\n#### Semi-finished?\\n\\nI\'m not too happy with how the game turned out. More about that in a future post.\\n\\n### Skills\\n\\nTo make a game, one must develop all kinds of skills, I probably cannot even list them all yet as odds are I haven\'t even stumbled upon them.\\n\\n**The goal is to be able to make games that represent my visions and ideas, that will require me to have at the very least, strong basic knowledge in many skills.**\\n\\nThis includes:\\n\\n- Art\\n- Music and sound effects\\n- Coding\\n- Game design\\n- UX and UI\\n- Whatever else games require!\\n\\nI plan to use various tools to help me along the way. [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/ \'Link to Aseprite\') for 2D, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for 3D, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for SFX, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as the game engine, ..\\n\\n### Thank you\\n\\nSo that\'s more or less what I can tell you about me and Problem 18 so far. I aim to keep these posts coming every second or third week, focusing on what I\'ve learned, what mistakes I made, what obstacles I stumbled upon, and announcing the games, of course.\\n\\n**If you\'re also into indie game development, whether you\'re a player or developer yourself, I would love to connect and learn about your adventures as well.
